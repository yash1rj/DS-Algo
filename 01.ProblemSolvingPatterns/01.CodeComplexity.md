## Time complexity

- It is how the runtime scales as the input grows.

- This is how we understand how a function/algorithm performs.

- It is denoted by Big O notation.


## Space complexity

- It refers to space required by the algorithm, not including space taken up by the inputs.

- Most primitives (boolean, number, undefined, null) takes constant space.

- Strings require O(n) space where n is length of string

- Reference types are generally O(n) where n could be length of array or no. of keys in an object


## Big O of Objects

When to use objects
- when we dont need order
- when we need fast access/insertion and removal

> Time complexity of object operations
- Insertion : O(1)
- Removal : O(1)
- Search : O(n)
- Access : O(1)

> Time complexity of object methods
- Object.keys() : O(n)
- Object.values() : O(n)
- Object.entries() : O(n)
- hasOwnProperty : O(1)


## Big O of Arrays

When to use objects
- when we need order
- when we need fast access/insertion and removal (but it depends)

> Time complexity of object operations
- Insertion : 
    - At start : O(n)
    - At end : O(1)
- Removal : O(1)
    - At start : O(n)
    - At end : O(1)
- Search : O(n)
- Access : O(1)

> Time complexity of object methods
- push, pop : O(1)
- shift, unshift : O(n)
- concat : O(n)
- slice, splice : O(n)
- sort : O(n log n)
- forEach, map, filter, reduce,... : O(n)
