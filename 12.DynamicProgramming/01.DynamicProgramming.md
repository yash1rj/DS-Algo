> Dynamic Programming

- It is a method for solving a complex problem by breaking it down into a collection of simpler subproblems, solving each of those subproblems just once, and storing their solutions.


> DP works on problems with :
    - Overlapping subproblems
    - Optimal substructure


- Overlapping subproblems :
    - a problem is said to have overlapping subproblems if it can be broken down into subproblems which are reused several times.

    - eg.   fib(5) -> fib(4) + fib(3)
            fib(4) -> fib(3) + fib(2)
            fib(3) -> fib(2) + fib(1) -> 1 + 1


- Optimal substructure
    - a problem is saif to have optimal substructure if an optimal solution can be constructed from optimal solution of its subproblems.

    - eg.   Shortest path
            A -> B -> -> C -> D
                 |    |
                 -> E -
            shortest path from :
                A to D : A-> B -> C -> D
                A to C : A -> B -> C
                A to B : A -> B
            shortest path of each subproblem with constitute shortest path of the main problem

    - another eg.   Longest non-repeating path
                    A -> B -> D
                         | (2-way)
                         C   
                    longest path from :
                        A to C : A-> B -> C
                        C to D : C -> B -> D
                        A to D : A -> B -> C -> B -> D  :  A -> B -> D
                    No optimal substructure


> Fibonacci :

```
function fib1(n) {
    if (n <= 2) return 1;
    return fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2);
}
```


> Memoization :

- Storing the results of expensive function calls and returning the cached result when the same input occurs again.

```
function fib2(n, memo = []) {
    if (memo[n] !== undefined) return memo[n];
    if (n <= 2) return 1;

    let res = fib(n - 1, memo) + fib(n - 2, memo);
    memo[n] = res;
    return res;
}
```


> Tabulation :

- Storing the results of a previous result in a "table" (usually an array).
- Usually done using iteration.
- Better space complexity can be achieved using tabulation.

```
function fib(n) {
    if (n <= 2) return 1;
    let fibNums = [0, 1, 1];
    for (let i = 3; i <= n; i++) {
        fibNums[i] = fibNums[i - 1] + fibNums[i - 2];
    }
    return fibNums[n];
}
```
