> Binary Search Tree

- A tree is a data structure that consists of nodes in a parent/child relationship.

- Lists -> linear
- Tress -> Non-linear

- eg. tree
(root)2 ----
    /  \    \
   9     7   99
  / \   / \
 2  40 44  11 

- eg. not a tree ; cyclic
(root)6
     / \
    7-8-12
   /    / \
  99   24 13

- eg. not a tree ; as single entry point (node) not present
(node1)2  8(node2)
      /  / \
     9 -/   12 
    /       / \
   2       44  11 


> Terminology

- Root : Top ode of tree
- Child : Node directly connected to another node when moving away from the root
- Parent : Conversion notion of a child
- Siblings : A group of nodes with same parent
- Leaf : A node with no children
- Edge : The connection between one node and another


> Applications :

- HTML DOM
- N/W routing
- Abstract syntax tree
- AI
- JSON
- Folders in OS
- Computer file system


> Binary Tree 

- Each node can have at most 2 children


> BST 

- Every parent node has at most 2 children
- Every node to the left of a parent node is always less than the parent
- Every node to the right of a parent node is always greater than the parent

- eg.
     10
    /  \
   5    13
  / \   / \
 2   8 14 16 


> WHen to use BFS and DFS ?

- For a wide breadth tree, DFS would be more suited. 
- Time complexity would be same as BFS but complexity will be less.

- DFS InOrder : here, we get all nodes in the tree in their underlying order. Used in BST's.
- DFS PreOrder : can be used to "export" a tree structure for easy re-construction.
