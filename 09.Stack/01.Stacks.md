> Stacks

- A LIFO (last-in-first-out) data structure.

- The last element added to the stack will be the first element removed from the stack


> Used in

- Managing function invocations
- Undo / redo
- Routing (the history object) is treated like a stack


> Implementation

- Requiremnt : should do push and pop in O(1) Time complexity

- By using array :
    - push and pop : O(1)
    - unshift and shift : O(n)

- Custom implementation :
    - push and pop : O(1)
