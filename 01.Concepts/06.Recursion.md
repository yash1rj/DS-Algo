> Call Stack

- It's a stack data structure.

- Any time a fn is invoked, it is placed (pushed) on the top of the call stack.

- When JS sees the return keyword or when the fn ends, the compiler will pop the fn from the call stack.

- When we write recursive fns, we keep pushing new fns onto the call stack.


> How Recursive fn works ?

- Invoke the same fn with a different input until we reach a base case.

- Base condition is thye condition where the recursion ends.


> Where things go wrong ?

- No base case
- Forgetting to return or returning the wrong thing
- Stack overflow


> Pure recursion

- Directrly uses recursion

- For arrays, use methods like slice, the spread operator and concat that makes copies of array so we dont mutate them

- Strings are immutable, so wee will need to use methods likle slice, substr or substring to make copies of strings

- To make copies of objects use Object.assign or the spread operator
