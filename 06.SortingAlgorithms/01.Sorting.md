> Sorting Algorithms

- Sorting is the process of rearraning the items in a collection (e.g. Array) so that items are in some kind of order.


> Built-in JS sort

- The default sort order is ascending to string unicode code points.

- It accepts an optional comparator function.

- The comparator looks at pairs of elements (a and b), determines the sort order based on the return value.
    - If it returns a negative number, a should come before b

    - If it returns a positive number, a should come after b

    - If it returns 0, a and b are the same as far as sort is concerned

- Examples
    -
    ```
    [6,4,15,10].sort((a,b) => a-b) // [4,6,10,15]
    ```

    
    ```
    [6,4,15,10].sort() // [10,15,4,6]
    ```

    
    ```
    ["steel", "Iron", "Cobalt"].sort((str1, str2) => {
        return str1.length - str2.length;
    }) // ["Iron", "Steel", "Cobalt"]
    ```


> Swapping functionality

- Many sorting algorithms involves some type of swapping functionality
- i.e. swapping two numbers to put them in order

```
// ES5
function swap(arr, idx1, idx2) {
    let temp = arr[idx1];
    arr[idx1] = arr[idx2];
    arr[idx2] = temp;
}
```

```
// ES6
const swap = (arr, idx1,idx2) => {
    [arr[idx1], arr[idx2]] = [arr[idx2], arr[idx1]];
}
```


> Bubble Sort 

- Time complexity (Best) : O(n)
- Time complexity (Avg) : O(n^2)
- Time complexity (Worst) : O(n^2)
- Space complexity : O(1)


> Selection Sort 

- Time complexity (Best) : O(n^2)
- Time complexity (Avg) : O(n^2)
- Time complexity (Worst) : O(n^2)
- Space complexity : O(1)


> Insertion Sort 

- Time complexity (Best) : O(n)
- Time complexity (Avg) : O(n^2)
- Time complexity (Worst) : O(n^2)
- Space complexity : O(1)


> Faster sorts ?

- There is a family of sorting algorithms that can improve time complexity from O(n^2) to O(n log n)

- There is a tradeoff between efficiency and simplicity

- The more efficient algorithms are much less simple and generally takes longer to understand


> Quick Sort 

- Time complexity (Best) : O(n log n)
- Time complexity (Avg) : O(n log n)
- Time complexity (Worst) : O(n^2) - if selected pivot is min/max value
- Space complexity : O(log n)

> Radix Sort 

- n -> length of array; k -> no. of digits (avg)
- Time complexity (Best) : O(n k)
- Time complexity (Avg) : O(n k)
- Time complexity (Worst) : O(n k)
- Space complexity : O(n + k)
